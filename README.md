## Overview
This addon adds the four nations bending styles from the show Avatar: The Last Airbender  to Minecraft Bedrock Edition!  Avatar is a popular TV show set in a world in which some people–known as benders–can telekinetically manipulate one of the four elements—water, earth, fire or air—through ‘bending’ inspired by Chinese martial arts. This addon brings Avatar: The Last Airbender (sometimes abbreviated as ATLA and also known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions) to Minecraft Bedrock Edition! This addon is the result of over 2 years of continued development, and it’s just finished being fully overhauled! I’m proud to say this is the best ATLA addon you’re going to get for Bedrock!
## Getting Started
When you spawn in, you should be prompted with a tutorial screen. If you don’t see this screen, the addon is not working, so refer to the troubleshooting section! After reading through the tutorial, the only thing you need to do to start bending is right-clicking (or long pressing) on your ‘Bending Scroll’ item in your inventory. The scroll is your key to everything bending: selecting your element, configuring your moveset, and managing your abilities. The first option you'll be presented with is to choose your style! In some servers (if an admin has enabled the setting through the admin menu, more on that later) you cannot choose Avatar, or the bending choice may be random (and/or final). For the sake of this guide, we'll choose Air!

<div align="left">
To wield your bending abilities, bind moves to your hotbar slots. When a move is bound to a slot, performing the associated action while that slot is active triggers the move. To bind a move, open your bending scroll and navigate to the "choose slots" page. When you open the interface, you'll see several tabs and columns to help you manage your setup. On the far-right tab, labeled "Choose Slots", you'll find a list corresponding to your hotbar slots (numbers 1 through 9). These are the slots where you can bind moves, allowing you to trigger specific actions in-game when those slots are selected or hovered over. <br/> <br/>
<div align="center">

![e4b5b66a-eaf1-4c5e-aea3-33ce71a01662](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d175a34-4141-436a-99af-0068137007b9)    
<div align="left">
  
## What are slots?
Slots represent the spaces in your hotbar that you can customize. Think of them as containers for the actions you want to use. Each slot can hold one move, which is an ability or action you can perform in the game. By assigning moves to these slots, you gain the ability to activate them by performing an action while the slot is selected.

1. Choose a Slot: Start by selecting a hotbar slot in the far-right tab labeled "Choose Slots". This selection corresponds directly to the numbers 1–9 on your hotbar in the game. For example, if you select slot 1, the move you bind will be triggered whenever that slot is selected
2. Select a Move: In the first column, titled "Choose Move", you'll see a list of available moves. Click on the move you want to assign to your selected slot
4. Choose a Binding: The second column, titled "Choose Binding", lets you define the action that will trigger the selected move. This could be an interaction like right-clicking, sneaking, or another input of your choice. Once you've made your selections, your chosen move will be bound to the selected slot with the specified binding. This setup gives you the freedom to customize how you interact with the game to suit your playstyle.

   
To streamline your gameplay further, the mod offers a feature called Movesets. These are essentially presets that allow you to save and load your bindings with ease. For example, you might create one moveset for combat scenarios and another for exploration. To access this feature, simply click the "Movesets" button in the interface. From there, you can save your current bindings as a new moveset or load a previously saved one. This system is particularly useful for players who like to switch between different styles of play without the hassle of manually rebinding moves each time. <br/><br/>

<div align="left">

## Skill Tree
The skill tree is a way to unlock new abilities and improve your bending skills. Each "skill" is a unique ability that you can unlock by spending XP. When you open the skill tree, you'll see an array of skills displayed—simply click on any skill to bring up a detailed description of what it offers. If the skill fits your strategy, click the confirm button to finalize your choice and unlock it. Be aware, however, that unlocking skills isn’t just about gaining power; it’s also about choosing your path carefully. Here’s an essential note: every skill has branching paths. When you choose a specific skill and commit to it, the alternate paths from that skill become locked, making it impossible to go back and pick them later. This means that your choices are meaningful and permanent, emphasizing strategy and careful planning as you progress. If you’re unsure or regret your decisions, don’t worry—you’re not stuck forever! The skill tree includes a "Reforge" option that allows you to reset all your choices and start fresh. To reset, simply click the Reforge Skill Tree button, and you’ll have the chance to rethink and rebuild your path from the ground up.<br/><br/>

<div align="left">

## Bending Moves
As you start, you’ll have access to a single move, but by actively bending and landing hits on enemies, you can unlock more. Bending moves come in three main types: standard, charged, and toggle. Standard moves are straightforward—activate them with a simple action. Charged moves require you to hold the action, depleting your chi over time; the move’s power depends on how much chi you use before releasing. Toggle moves, on the other hand, stay active until you deactivate them by repeating the action. Keep in mind that toggle moves continuously consume chi while active, so use them wisely. Bending is fueled by chi, represented by a bar above your hunger gauge, so keeping an eye on it is crucial. In the HUD UI, you'll notice a sidebar (right side) that shows which moves are binded to which slots, as well as some text next to your slots, which displays the current move slot!<br/><br/>
<div align="center">

![2b51ab3a-38fb-4016-8a6c-fb2649a62d09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c4c38c-045e-440a-b4d8-e3c292e372dc)
<div align="left">

## Focus & Overflow
When PVPing in this addon, these two are very important concepts: focus is a measure of how many attacks you have in a row (and how much damage those hits dealt); and overflow is a state you can reach by maxing out your focus bar. Each successful hit (chained in a row, so without being hit yourself) builds up your focus bar. Once the bar is full, you’ll enter chi overflow, a temporary state that enhances your chi regeneration and increases your move damage. This is indicated by your bar being outlined in a gold color! This is an excellent opportunity to unleash devastating combos on your foes.

### Overview
Airbenders are centered around avoiding and then countering with a powerful counterattack. It concentrates on speed and evasion, forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Your moves are super strong (although not exactly good for offense), but you have little health, so speed, evasion, and redirection are important.

### Overview
Earth is the element of substance, while the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse, strong, and enduring. The key to earthbending is utilizing neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to strike and, when that moment comes, acting decisively. In other words, earthbenders generally endure their enemies' attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself.

### Skill Tree

If you're in the air and hook an entity, it's pulled toward you and stalled in the air for a combo (punch it). If you hook down while in the air, you'll shoot to the ground and create a shockwave, which launches mobs into the air. If you then look up and grapple them, you'll pull yourself up towards them and stall in the air for another combo!
* Seismic Sense: See the world around you in a new way, by sensing the vibrations in the earth. This move draws colored lines to the closest 5 entities (in a 48 block radius) around you! The color of the line indicates the entity's type. Red is hostile, green is neutral, blue is items, players are orange, and the rest is yellow!

## Thank you!
This addon has been developed and updated over a period of the last 2 years. In that time, it’s come so unbelievably far. Thank you to everyone who has helped me (and in some cases are still helping me) create this. Thank you to Theorist, R4isen, IBk, Flame, Deathbot, Zackeryruin, iHeroic, and so many more (especially patrons).
